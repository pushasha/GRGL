Pronounced "Gurgle", GRGL is a highly extensible and easy-to-use API/library to simplify the management of common RPG elements such as quests, dialogue, characters, etc. in the development of role-playing video games. This version of GRGL is meant to be used with the C# .NET programming language.

A work in progress.

See GRGL's progress at the official blog, [here](http://grgl.ghoster.io/).
